## Roadmap
- [x] Preprocess and prepare the training data

- [x] Train and evaluate a vanilla deep recurrent neural network (RNN)

- [x] Use pytorch framework to train the RNN network
- [ ] Optimize the model and propose enhancement:
	- Pruning
	- Mean belonging of a word to a category
	- Early stopping + LSTM
	- "Repeat before Forgetting: Spaced Repetition for Efficient and Effective Training of Neural Networks"
- [ ] Prepare the final defense
- [ ] Present your model and the obtained results
