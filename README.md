## Roadmap
:heavy_check_mark: - Preprocess and prepare the training data
- Train and evaluate a vanilla deep recurrent neural network (RNN)
- Use pytorch framework to train the RNN network
- Optimize the model and propose enhancement:
	- Pruning
	- Mean belonging of a word to a category
	- Early stopping + LSTM
	- "Repeat before Forgetting: Spaced Repetition for Efficient and Effective Training of Neural Networks"
- Prepare the final defense
- Present your model and the obtained results
